## Voice Characteristics

### How we write

1. **Direct and confident** — We speak with authority about Fire Horse traits. No hedging ("might be", "could be"). Fire Horses ARE powerful, charismatic, independent.

2. **Inclusive and welcoming** — Whether you're a Fire Horse (born 1966), expecting in 2026, or just zodiac-curious, you belong here.

3. **Educational without being academic** — Explain Chinese astrology clearly but avoid dry encyclopedia tone. Make it engaging.

4. **Empowering, never fearful** — Reclaim the Fire Horse narrative. Address the superstitions but emphasize strength over danger.

5. **Passionate but not dramatic** — Use fire/flame metaphors naturally, not forced. "Blaze your path" yes, "ignite the inferno of destiny" no.
