## EMAIL 2: Education (Day 3)

### Subject Lines

**Primary:**
The shocking reason Japan feared 1966 babies

**A/B Alternative 1:**
Why Fire Horse daughters terrified an entire country 🐴

**A/B Alternative 2:**
1966: The year Japan stopped having babies

### Preview Text
In 1966, Japan's birth rate dropped 25% because of an ancient Fire Horse superstition. Here's the wild story.

### Body Copy

**[HEADER IMAGE: Vintage 1966 Japanese newspaper clipping with Fire Horse illustration]**

**Hey [First Name],**

Quick question: Would you *not* have a child because of their zodiac sign?

Sounds absurd, right? But in 1966, Japan experienced a **25% drop in birth rates** — the sharpest decline in modern history — because parents were terrified of having Fire Horse daughters.

**Here's the wild backstory:**

An ancient Japanese superstition claimed Fire Horse women were "untamable," would bring misfortune to their families, and might even kill their husbands. The belief was so strong that:

- Couples delayed pregnancies or scheduled C-sections to avoid the Fire Horse year
- Hospitals reported a surge in births in late 1965 and early 1967
- The 1966 generation in Japan is still noticeably smaller today

**The irony?** Many of the 1966 babies who *were* born became wildly successful. Janet Jackson. Mike Tyson. Salma Hayek. Cindy Crawford. All Fire Horses. All fierce, independent, unstoppable — exactly as predicted, but without the tragedy.

**3 more fascinating Fire Horse facts:**

**1. The 60-year cycle mystery**
The Fire Horse only appears once every 60 years because it requires the perfect alignment of the Fire element (丙 Bing) and the Horse zodiac (午 Wu). Next Fire Horse year after 2026? **2086.**

**2. Fire Horses in ancient China**
Historically, Fire Horse individuals were seen as natural-born leaders and warriors — traits celebrated in men but feared in women (classic patriarchy). The "dangerous woman" narrative was a cultural construct, not an astrological truth.

**3. Modern Fire Horse traits**
Today's astrology sees Fire Horses as passionate, charismatic, freedom-loving, and driven. They're the entrepreneurs, the artists, the change-makers. Sound like anyone you know?

**Want to go deeper?**

Our Encyclopedia has 8 researched articles covering Fire Horse history, cultural significance, famous Fire Horses, the Japan superstition, and how the elements interact in Chinese astrology.

**No fluff. No clickbait. Just thoroughly researched astrology and cultural history.**

We spent months digging through historical records, interviewing astrologers, and fact-checking every claim. If you're the type who wants to *actually understand* Fire Horse symbolism (not just read horoscopes), you'll love this.

**Keep blazing,**
The FireHorse Team

### Automation Flow

**TRIGGER: Netlify Forms submission (newsletter signup)**

```
Form Submit → Webhook → ESP API
  ↓
Subscriber added to "Welcome Sequence" list
  ↓
Email 1 sent immediately (0-5 min delay max)
  ↓
3-day wait
  ↓
Email 2 sent (Day 3, 10am subscriber's timezone if available)
  ↓
4-day wait
  ↓
Email 3 sent (Day 7, 10am subscriber's timezone if available)
  ↓
EXIT: Move to "Active Subscribers" list
```

**ERROR HANDLING:**

- **If subscriber unsubscribes mid-sequence:** Remove from list immediately, cancel scheduled emails
- **If email bounces (hard bounce):** Remove from list, flag email as invalid
- **If email bounces (soft bounce):** Retry 3x over 24 hours → mark as soft-bounce if all fail

### Sequence Timing

| Email | Timing | Send Window |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Email 1 | Day 0 | Immediate (within 5 minutes of signup) |
| Email 2 | Day 3 | 10am subscriber timezone (fallback: 10am PST) |
| Email 3 | Day 7 | 10am subscriber timezone (fallback: 10am PST) |

**Total sequence duration:** 7 days

---

### Segmentation Strategy

**Initial Launch (Phase 1):**
- **Segment:** None — all subscribers receive same sequence
- **List name:** "Welcome Sequence - All Subscribers"

**Future Segmentation (Phase 2 — implement after 500+ subscribers):**

Segment by source:
1. **Homepage signups** → Current sequence (compatibility-first)
2. **Blog readers** → Content-heavy variant (more educational, less CTA)
3. **Forum browsers** → Community-first variant (forum CTA in Email 1)

Segment by engagement:
1. **Clicked Email 1 CTA** → Fast-track to forum invite in Email 2
2. **No opens after Email 2** → Re-engagement email before Email 3
3. **High engagement (opened all 3)** → Move to "VIP" segment for future exclusive content

---

### Exit Conditions

Subscriber exits the sequence when:

1. **Completes sequence** → Moved to "Active Subscribers" list (weekly newsletter)
2. **Unsubscribes** → Removed from all lists, no further emails
3. **Hard bounce** → Email invalid, removed from all lists
4. **Marks as spam** → Immediately removed, email flagged
5. **Upgrades to forum member** → Moved to "Forum Members" list (different email cadence)

**Post-sequence journey:**
- Active Subscribers list receives bi-weekly newsletter (not yet built)
- Forum Members list receives weekly community digest (not yet built)

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**Copy is deployment-ready.** Content can be copy-pasted directly into ESP template editor (Resend, Brevo, Mailchimp) with these formatting adjustments:

1. **[HEADER IMAGE]** → Replace with actual image URL hosted on firehorse.info CDN
2. **[First Name]** → Replace with ESP merge tag (e.g., `{{first_name}}` in Resend, `{FNAME}` in Mailchimp)
3. **[CTA BUTTON]** → Style with brand colors (fire-400 #fb923c background, ash-50 text, glass-strong effect if ESP supports)
4. **[FOOTER]** → Use ESP's standard footer template with unsubscribe/preferences links

**UTM parameters are complete** — all links include proper tracking for GA4 analysis.

**Subject line emojis** follow 2026 best practices (1 emoji max, placed at end or beginning, relevant to content).

**Preview text optimized** for ~50 characters (mobile Gmail preview length).
